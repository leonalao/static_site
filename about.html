                <p>We all have different kinds of families, and different kinds of family relationships. For many of us, family is both precious and precarious. And for many of us, we could probably get to know our families a little better.</p>
    
                <p>Since the ECQ, my family and I have been having daily "getting to know you" questions. Every day, one person asks a question, and we take turns to answer.</p>
                
                <p>This is a simple webpage that just shows a random question on load. The hope is that you can use it to spark a conversation with the people you love, too. ðŸ’–</p>
