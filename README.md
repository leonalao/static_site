# Family Togetherness
This is a simple webpage that just shows a random "getting to know you" question on load. You can refresh it for a new random question. The hope is that you can use it to spark a conversation with the people you love. ðŸ’–

It's built as static webpages with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript â€” a quick exercise for me to get back into web development, and also to try Github Pages for the first time.

Features that would be great to add if this were a bigger project:
- Add questions
- Remove questions
- Select a category of questions
